Read Me Generator
by Danielle Woessner
In today's fast-paced development landscape, creating clear and comprehensive documentation is essential for any project hosted on GitHub. A ReadMe generator developed with JavaScript, Node.js, and JSON can streamline this process, offering developers a command-line application that efficiently composes Markdown files. This tool allows users to input key project details, such as title, description, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines, ensuring that all necessary information is captured succinctly. By automating the generation of the ReadMe file, developers can focus more on coding while still providing potential collaborators and users with the thorough documentation they require, enhancing both usability and collaboration within the open-source community.
This Read Me Generator was created using Node.Js, Java Script and JSON, as well as the [Inquirer package]('https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer?activeTab=readme'). This application will be invoked by using the following command

```
node index.js
```
